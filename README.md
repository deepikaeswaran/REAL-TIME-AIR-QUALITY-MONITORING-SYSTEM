🌍 Real-Time Air Quality Monitoring System using IoT and Machine Learning
This project predicts Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂) levels in real-time using simulated IoT sensor data and live weather parameters from the OpenWeather API. It integrates data fusion, preprocessing, and ML-based predictions (XGBoost & LSTM) to alert users about air quality status via an interactive web dashboard with maps and charts.
